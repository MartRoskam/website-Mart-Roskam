Even though she wasn't there to accept the award, the co-producer of the short film, Saul Germaine delivered a short-and-sweet speech thanking Taylor as well as the video's team and two stars, Sadie Sink and Dylan Oâ€™Brien. "It was an incredible honor to tell this story with you," Germaine said. </p>
