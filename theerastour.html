                <p>On the 4th, 5th and 6th of July in 2024 Taylor will be performing in the Johan Cruijff Arena in Amsterdam. The stadium has a capacity of around 56000 people and is mainly used for football matches and concerts. Sadly I wasn't able to get tickets due to me not being a swiftie when the sale started.</p>
